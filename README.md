    Latency Monitoring: Displays home and world latency in milliseconds, with color-coded indicators for performance (green for optimal, yellow for caution, and red for high latency).
    FPS Display: Monitors and shows the current frames per second, helping players gauge the responsiveness of their game.
    Memory Usage Tracking: Calculates and displays the total memory usage of all loaded addons, allowing users to manage and optimize their gaming experience.
    Memory Cleanup: Offers a "Clean Memory" button that triggers garbage collection to free up memory resources, ensuring smoother gameplay.
